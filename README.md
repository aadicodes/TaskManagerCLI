# TaskManagerCLI
Python program that provides a command line interface to create user specific tasks and manage the same.

I created this Python program as part of a project assignment. I had to put all code in one file due to a limitation from the portal I used to submit for review. 
Feel free to refer this to get a basic idea of how Python can be used to build a CLI tool. Also if you make a copy, modularize the code as a fun task.
